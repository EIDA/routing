Specification - v1.2
====================

Overview of the service
-----------------------

.. todo:: Need to include description of the "fdsn" format.

Purpose
'''''''

To provide the URL(s) where a client can request information to a service for
a specific stream and in a particular time window.

Conceptual Architecture
'''''''''''''''''''''''

This service provides routing information for distributed data centers, in the
case where multiple different seismic data centres offer access to data and
products using compatible types of services. Examples of the data and product
objects are seismic timeseries waveforms, station inventory, or quality
parameters from the waveforms. The
`European Integrated Data Archive <http://www.orfeus-eu.org/eida/eida.html>`_
(EIDA) is an example of a set of distributed data centres (the EIDA „nodes“).
EIDA have offered Arclink and Seedlink services for many years, and now offer
FDSN web services, for accessing their holdings. In keeping with the
distributed nature of EIDA, these services could run at different nodes.
Depending on the type of service, these may only provide information about a
reduced subset of all the available waveforms.

To assist users or clients to locate data, we have designed a Routing Service,
which could run at EIDA nodes or elsewhere. This (meta)service is queried by
clients (or other services) and provides the address(es) where, within the
context of EIDA, the desired information is provided.

To be effective, the Routing Service must know the locations of all services
integrated into a system (e.g. EIDA) and serve this information in order to
help the development of smart clients and/or services at a higher level, which
can offer the user an integrated view of the entire system (EIDA), hiding the
complexity of its internal structure.

The service is intended to be open and able to be queried by anyone without the
need of credentials or authentication.

Services could be classified or located at different layers, depending on the
type and amount of information they provide, if it is aggregated or not, etc.
In the context of this document we will only take into account the services
running at the “node level”. Namely, services that provide partial information
related to a node within EIDA: these services only offer content related to
data which is local to each node. Services that provide already aggregated
information are not considered herein.


General Features
''''''''''''''''

We prioritize some key concepts common to any good design process in software
engineering when designing the Routing Service. Some of them are:

  * Simplicity: Provide an atomic, simple and reduced business process.
  * Consistency with standards: Parameter names, formats and types follow
    similar existing services (e.g. FDSN web services) whenever possible.
  * Stateless: The service will neither create nor store information related
    to sessions, connections or results, beyond that needed to check that it
    is operating correctly.
  * Platform independence: The interoperability between different services/
    clients is mandatory and there are no assumptions made concerning either
    on the underlying software implementations, or on the hardware used.
  * Traffic friendly: The service should constrain to a minimum the amount of
    information sent/received.
  * Detailed Errors: The service must return a comprehensive and detailed
    description of the error(s) found.

Service path and port
'''''''''''''''''''''

The following base URL pattern is to be used for the deployment of the
service: ::

  <site>/<relative-path>/routing/<majorversion>/

where relative-path is optional (it will be necessary when the service does
not run at the top level inside the site) and `majorversion` is an integer value
that determines the major specification version supported by the service. An
example could be: ::

  http://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/eidaws/routing/1/

It is suggested that the service should be available for TCP/IP connections at
port 80, but it could also work on non-standard ports.

Available methods
-----------------

Four methods are defined following the FDSN style: `application.wadl`,
`version`, `query` and `info`. The first three methods behave in a similar way
as in the standard FDSN web services (http://fdsn.org/webservices) and are
described in detail in the following sections. The `info` method is intended
to provide human-readable information about the content provided by the
service (see Section 5.4).

Description of the service
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The `application.wadl` method shall return a WADL conformant description of
the interface using the MIME type `application/xml`. Any parameters submitted
with the method will be ignored. The WADL shall describe all parameters
supported by the interface and is primarily used to document the service and
whether some optional parameters are supported.

Version of the implementation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The `version` method shall return the implementation version as a simple text
string using the MIME type `text/plain`. Any parameters submitted with the
method will be ignored. This scheme follows the FDSN web services approach.

The service is versioned according the following three-digit (x.y.z)
pattern: ::

  SpecMajor.SpecMinor.Implementation

where the fields have the following meaning:

  * SpecMajor: The major specification version, all implementations sharing
    this value will be backwards compatible with all prior releases. Values
    start at 1.
  * SpecMinor: The minor specification version, incremented when optional
    parameters or behavior is added to the previous specification but backwards
    compatibility is maintained with the previous major versions, i.e. all
    1.y.z service versions will be compatible with version 1.0. Values are
    integers starting at 0.
  * Implementation: The implementation version, an integer identifier specific
    to the data center implementation. Useful to track service updates for bug
    fixes, etc. but with no implication on conformance to the specification.

Together the `SpecMajor` and `SpecMinor` versions imply a minimum expected
behaviour of a given service. This versioning scheme allows clients to expect
specific behaviour based on the `SpecMajor` version, while allowing the
extension of the service with optional parameters while maintaining backwards
compatibility. Each version number is service specific, there is no implication
that `SpecMajor` version numbers across services (from EIDA or FDSN) are
related.


Querying the service
''''''''''''''''''''

The `query` method is how the users access the main functionality of the
service. Both `GET` and `POST` methods must be supported.

Input parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The complete list of input parameters can be seen in Table
:ref:`Table 1<Table_1>`. Parameter names must be in lower case, and may be
abbreviated as shown in the first column, following the FDSN style. Valid
input values must have the format shown in the "Format" column. All the values
passed as parameters will be case-insensitive strings composed of numbers and
letters. No other symbols will be allowed with the exception of:

  #. wildcards ('*' and '?'), which may be used to select the streams (for
     parameters `network`, `station`, `location` and `channel` only),
  #. the symbols ':', '-' (minus) and '.', which are specified in the ISO 8601
     format for dates (`starttime` and `endtime`), and
  #. the string '--' (two minus symbols), which may be used only for the
     `location` parameter.

For the wildcards accepted in the case of `network`, `station`, `location` and
`channel`. The character '*' matches any value, while '?' matches any
character. For any of these four parameters, if no value is given it will be
set to a star ('*').

Blank or empty location identifiers may be specified as "--" (two dashes) if
needed, which the service must translate to an empty string.

 ================= ======== ======== ================================ ==========


Output description and format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At least two different output formats must be supported by any implementation
(`xml`, `json`), while two more formats are recommended (`get`, `post`). The
structure of the information returned is different with each format type. In
case of a successful request the HTTP status code will be 200, and the response
will be as described below for each format.


Output: XML format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the default selection if the parameter `format` is not specified or if
it is given with an `xml` value. The MIME type must be set to `text/xml`. The
following is an example of the expected XML structure. The `params` element
will be repeated as many times as necessary inside the `datacenter`. Each
`datacenter` element must contain:

  * exactly one `url` element, specifying the URL of the service at a given
    data centre,
  * exactly one `name` element, which gives the name of the service, and
  * a list of `params` elements, each describing a stream, or set of streams
    by using appropriate wildcarding, available using the service at that URL.
    The `params` element may be repeated as many times as necessary inside the
    `datacenter` element.

For instance, ::

  <service>
    <datacenter>
      <url>http://ws.resif.fr/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query</url>
        <params>
          <loc>*</loc>
          <end>2012-04-20T23:59:00</end>
          <sta>KES28</sta>
          <cha>*</cha>
          <priority>1</priority>
          <start>2011-09-15T00:00:00</start>
          <net>4C</net>
        </params>
      <name>dataselect</name>
    </datacenter>
  </service>

Output: JSON format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the format parameter is `json`, the information will be returned with MIME
type `text/plain`. The content will be a JSON (Java Script Object Notation
[#f1]_) array, in which each element is a JSON object corresponding to a
`datacenter` element in the XML format shown above. For the example response
above, this would appear as[#f2]_: ::

  [{"url": "http://ws.resif.fr/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query", "params": [{"loc":
  "*", "end": "2012-04-20T23:59:00", "sta": "KES28", "cha": "*", "priority": 1,
  "start": "2011-09-15T00:00:00", "net": "4C"}], "name": "dataselect"}]

It should be noted that the value associated with `params` is an array of
objects and that there will be as many objects as needed for the same
datacenter.

.. [#f1] See *"Introducing JSON"*, http://json.org; and ECMA International,
         *"The JSON Data Interchange Format"*, ECMA-404, 1st edition, October
         2013.
.. [#f2] The information describing every format will be the same as in the
         first example (XML).

Output: GET format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note ::
    This option is not mandatory, but due to practical reasons is highly
    recommended. It should be noted that it could not make sense for some
    services, but it will be very helpful for services using a similar URI
    construction as the FDSN-WS (e.g. dataselect and station).

When the `format` parameter is set to `get`, the output will be declared as
`text/plain` and will consist of one URL per line. This option will only be
available with known services where the usage of a URL via the GET method is
allowed (e.g. FDSN web services). The URLs will be constructed in a way that
they can be used directly by the client to request the necessary information
without the need to parse them. For instance: ::

  http://ws.resif.fr/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query?sta=KES28&net=4C&start=...

Output: POST format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note ::
    This option is not mandatory, but due to practical reasons is highly
    recommended. It should be noted that it could not make sense for some
    services, but it will be very helpful for services using a similar URI
    construction as the FDSN-WS (e.g. dataselect and station).

If `format` is `post`, the output will be declared as `text/plain` and the
structure will consist of:

  * a line with a URL where the request must be made,
  * a list of lines with the format declared in the FDSN-WS specification
    to do a POST request [#f3]_.

.. [#f3] If start and end dates are not specified, they will not be present
         in the output and the lines cannot be used directly as POST body.
         They need to be completed later by the client, before sending the
         request.

This option will only be available with known services where the usage of a
URL is allowed (e.g.  FDSN web services). If the request should be split in
more than one datacenter, the blocks for every datacenter will be separated
by a blank line and the structure will be repeated (URL and POST body). ::

  http://ws.resif.fr/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query
  4C KES28 * * 2011-09-15T00:00:00 2012-04-20T23:59:00

Alternative routes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the `alternative` parameter is set, the service will return all the routes
that match the requested criteria without filtering them by priority.
Alternative routes are indicated by the `priority` attriute. The client will
be required to interpret the priority of the routes and to select the
combination of routes that best fits their needs to request the information.
The client needs also to take care of checking the information to detect
overlapping routes, which will definitely occur when a primary and an
alternative route are being reported for the same stream.

.. note ::
    As a rule of a thumb and in a normal case, the alternative addresses
    should only be used if there is no response from the authoritative data
    centre (priority=1).

It should be noted that the for `get` and `post` format outputs, `priority`
cannot be returned. Additional parsing of other formats are required to
interpret priority.

How to pass the parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*GET*: the parameters must be given in `key=value` pairs separated by '&'. ::

  http://server_url?key1=value1&key2=value2


*POST*: The first lines could be used to pass the parameters not related to
streams or time windows (`service`, `format`, `alternative`) with one
`key=value` clause per line. For instance, ::

  service=station

For the six parameters used to select streams and timewindows, one
stream+timewindow is expected per line and the format must be: ::

  NET STA LOC CHA START END

If there is no defined time window, an empty string should be given as ‘’ or
“” (see the section with :ref:`Examples<Examples>` to get a better understanding of the
details)

Abnormal responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to a `200 OK` status code for a successful request, other responses
are possible, as shown in Table :ref:`Table 2<Table_2>`. These are essentially
the same as for FDSN web services. Under error, maintenance or other unusual
conditions a client may receive other HTTP codes generated by web service
containers, and other intermediate web technology.

.. _Table_2:

.. table:: HTTP status codes returned by the Routing service

 ===== =======================================================================
 Code  Description
 ===== =======================================================================
 200    OK, Successful request, results follow.
 204    Request was properly formatted and submitted but no data matches the
        selection.
 400    Bad request due to improper specification, unrecognized parameter,
        parameter value out of range, etc.
 413    Request would result in too much data being returned or the request
        itself is too large. Returned error
        message should include the service limitations in the detailed
        description. Service limits should
        also be documented in the service WADL.
 414    Request URI too large
 500    Internal server error
 503    Service temporarily unavailable, used in maintenance and error
        conditions

.. _infomethod:

Information about the content of service
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When the method `info` is invoked, a description about the information handled
by the Routing Service should be returned. The answer must be of MIME type
`text/plain` and is actually a text-free output. However, in the first lines
it is expected to be specified which information we can find by querying the
service. For instance, ::

  All Networks from XYZ institution
  Stations in Indonesia
  Stations in San Francisco

  Other comments and descriptions that could be of interest of the user.

Any parameter passed to this method will be ignored.


.. _Examples:

Examples
--------

In the first five examples, the `service`, `starttime` and `endtime`
parameters take their default values. Namely, `dataselect` for the service and
`Any` for start and end time. Here we show requests to a hypothetical Routing
Service deployment running at `server.org` [#f4]_.

.. [#f4] In the server responses below, white space and blank lines have been
         added for readability, but servers do not need to include them.

**1. Where do I get waveforms via dataselect from the station APE belonging**
     **to network GE?**

http://server.org/eidaws/routing/query?net=GE&sta=APE

Answer: ::

Wildcards are set for `location` and `channel`. BHZ stream is available at
ODC, while HHZ and LHZ are available at ETH.

**5. Where do I get waveforms via dataselect from the BHZ channel of the**
     **station BZS belonging to network RO? The response should be provided**
     **in GET format.**

http://server.org/eidaws/routing/query?net=RO&sta=BZS&cha=BHZ&format=get

Answer: ::

  http://eida-sc3.infp.ro/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query?sta=BZS&cha=BHZ&net=RO

This stream can be obtained from NIEP and the response can be directly used to
request the data without the need to parse or interpret it.

**6. Where do I access the "generic" service for the BHZ channel of the**
     **station BZS belonging to network RO? The response should be provided**
     **in JSON format.**

http://server.org/eidaws/routing/query?net=RO&sta=BZS&cha=BHZ&format=json&service=generic

Answer: ::

  [{"url": "http://eida-sc3.infp.ro/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query", "params":
   [{"loc": "*", "end": "", "sta": "BZS", "cha": "BHZ", "priority": 1,
     "start": "1980-01-01T00:00:00", "net": "RO"}], "name": "generic"}]

The "generic" service for this stream can be accessed at NIEP.

**7. Which address has the dataselect server who serves locally waveforms of**
     **the first hour of 2014 from the 5E network?**

http://server.org/eidaws/routing/query?net=5E&service=dataselect&start=2014-01-01T00:00:00&end=2014-01-01T01:00:00

Answer: ::

  Error 204 - No Content

No routes can be found, because the network was operational between 2011 and
2013.

**8. Where do I get waveforms via dataselect from 2012-02-02 to 2012-03-02**
     **from the 4C network? Give me the results ready to do the request via**
     **a POST method.**

http://server.org/routing/query?net=4C&start=2012-02-02T00:00:00&end=2012-03-02T00:00:00&format=post

The data from this network is distributed among the three institutions.

.. [#f5] Only some lines are shown as an example for each data center. The
         real answer is much longer.
